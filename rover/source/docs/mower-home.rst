Autonomous Mowers and Tractors
==============================

There is an active and growing community using ArduPilot Rovers for lawn mowing and agricultural applications. Many have converted gasoline-powered zero-turn (ZTR) riding mowers to autonomous operation, and a few have even designed custom vehicles from the ground up.  These self-guided mowers are capable of running mowing missions entirely autonomously, which can be defined via mission planning software.
